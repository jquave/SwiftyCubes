### SwiftyCubes

A demo of working with programmatic UIViews, using UIDynamics, and handling touches manually.
Also bouncy cubes.

There's no tutorial or anything yet, so I added a bunch of comments.
100% of the logic is in ViewController.swift, so just look at that. The rest is your basic template.
Enjoy!
